# CPLib-Cristime

This is an simple but efficient lib for competitive programming, which 
includes many algorithms and data structures.

Although it isn't strong enough, I'll put efforts on it and make it open 
source, so that the lib is going to help more and more OIers or ACMers.

Each algorithm or data structure is designed to be included with only a single header file ( or including another .cpp file ). This makes my 
codes easier to use.

Many *CPLib* provided on GitHub usually contain complex 
and modern C++ features. Complex features increase the 
difficulty in reading codes. **But** this library uses 
simple and effective methods to describe an algorithm or
data structure, so it is suitable for beginners, especially for those teens who know quite few modern C++ features. ( ~~In Fact, I don't know many new features as well.~~ )

At last, put my compiler settings here:
```bash
Operating System: Windows 7/10
Editor: Visual Studio Code
Compiler: TDM-GCC 10.3 based on MinGW-W64
Browser: Chrome
```
